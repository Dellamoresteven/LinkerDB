/************************************************************
* The read() function will read from all the logs in the    *
* log files. I made the write function more advanced        *
* so reading will be simple. All the read function needs    *
* to do is to run the commands that are in the files.       *
* This is an important design choice that I made when       *
* saving files because of how it will help people debug     *
* and change the logs if need be.                           *
